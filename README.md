# 🧩 I²C Address Translator
Recruitment Task – Vicharak Technologies

# 🧾 1. Abstract
The I²C Address Translator is a digital communication bridge designed to resolve address conflicts between multiple I²C slave devices sharing the same physical address.
In a standard I²C system, multiple devices with identical addresses cannot coexist on the same bus.
This project overcomes that limitation by introducing an FPGA-based translation layer that maps unique virtual addresses to a common physical address.

The translator acts as:
      1. I²C Slave to the external master (e.g., microcontroller or processor).
      2. I²C Master to one or more target slave devices.

This allows seamless and transparent read/write communication between the external master and the target slaves through address translation logic.

# 🧩 2. Overview
This project implements an I²C Address Translator using Verilog HDL.
The module operates as an I²C slave on the main bus (connected to a host master) and as an I²C master on the target bus (connected to downstream slave devices).

It dynamically translates the address of the target device while maintaining data integrity, enabling communication between devices with conflicting I²C addresses.

# ⚙️ 3. Functional Description
Main Bus (Slave Side): Receives I²C transactions from the host master.

Target Bus (Master Side): Initiates I²C transactions to the selected slave device.

Translation Logic: Modifies the address field in the I²C packet while maintaining data consistency.

Bidirectional Data Handling: Supports both read and write operations.

Clock & Data Line Control: Maintains synchronization and timing according to I²C protocol standards (Standard / Fast Mode).
