# I-C-Translator
This project implements an I²C Address Translator in Verilog HDL. It acts as a slave on the main bus and a master on the target bus, enabling address translation with bidirectional read/write support. Designed using FSMs, verified on FPGA with Vivado for standard and fast I²C modes.
